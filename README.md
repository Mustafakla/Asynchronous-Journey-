-----  Day 1: Basics and Fetch API-----


My initial exercises to understand the core logic of Asynchronous programming.

*Promise: Three step-by-step examples to grasp the logic.

*Fetch API: Practice on fetching data.

Note: I will build a comprehensive asynchronous project after completing this 7-day challenge. ( 1/7 )



----- Day 2: Promise Chaining & Promise.all -------



Today, I explored how to manage multiple asynchronous operations and process data in a sequence.

*Promise Chaining: Learned how to process data step-by-step using multiple .then() blocks.

*Promise.all: Learned how to fetch multiple pieces of data (temperature, wind, humidity) simultaneously to save time.

*Error Handling: Used throw new Error with !response.ok to handle HTTP errors professionally.

----- Day 3: Modern Async/Await & Try-Catch -------


Today, I moved away from .then() chains and embraced the modern way of writing asynchronous code.

* Async/Await: Learned how to write asynchronous code that looks and behaves like synchronous code using the `async` and `await` keywords.
* Proffesional Error Handling : Implemented `try-catch` blocks to manage errors.
