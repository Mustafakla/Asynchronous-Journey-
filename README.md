-----  Day 1: Basics and Fetch API-----


My initial exercises to understand the core logic of Asynchronous programming.

*Promise: Three step-by-step examples to grasp the logic.

*Fetch API: Practice on fetching data.





----- Day 2: Promise Chaining & Promise.all -------



Today, I explored how to manage multiple asynchronous operations and process data in a sequence.

*Promise Chaining: Learned how to process data step-by-step using multiple .then() blocks.

*Promise.all: Learned how to fetch multiple pieces of data (temperature, wind, humidity) simultaneously to save time.

*Error Handling: Used throw new Error with !response.ok to handle HTTP errors professionally. 




----- Day 3: Modern Async/Await & Try-Catch -------


Today, I moved away from .then() chains and embraced the modern way of writing asynchronous code.

* Async/Await: Learned how to write asynchronous code that looks and behaves like synchronous code using the async and await keywords.
* Proffesional Error Handling : Implemented try-catch blocks to manage errors.





-------Day 4: Working with Real-World APIs--------


Today, I practiced fetching live data from a real API (JSONPlaceholder) and manipulating it.
